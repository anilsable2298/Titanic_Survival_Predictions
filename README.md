# Titanic_Survival_Predictions
Problem Statement

• The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model that answers the question : “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using Passenger Data.

Revealing Insights from the Depths:

* As I delved into the passenger data, a narrative began to emerge. The age of the passengers, in its majority, fell within the span of 20 to 40 years, with a median age of 28, a poignant reminder of the youth that was lost on that icy night.
* The price of a ticket, a seemingly mundane detail, held secrets of its own. The 75th quartile for the fare was a modest $31, but a solitary ticket held the staggering value of $512, a stark contrast echoing the profound disparity in socio-economic classes among the passengers.
* The data presented a subtle imbalance in the target variable 'survived,' though not grave enough to demand special treatment. It whispered that, in this machine learning odyssey, the choice of evaluation metrics would be vital to navigate the treacherous waters, and so we would turn to precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC 
  for guidance.
* In the tale of the Titanic, 38.38% of passengers defied the odds and survived, a testament to human resilience in the face of disaster.
* Amongst the passengers, the dominance of the male contingent was unmistakable, with a staggering 64.76% majority. The ship's gender dynamics reflected the social norms of the time, and this played a role in survival.
* The third-class ticket was the most common, held by 55.11% of the passengers, underscoring the prevalence of the working class on board.
* Southampton, a port of dreams and departures, stood as the point of origin for the majority, with 72.44% embarking from its shores.
* The ratio of parents to children on board was a modest 0.39, signifying that 39% of passengers were bound by familial ties.
* In the tapestry of relationships, the ratio of siblings to spouses stood at 0.52, weaving the story of those who shared their voyage with brothers, sisters, or life partners.
* In a cruel twist of fate, the more significant the number of siblings, spouses, or parents and children on board, the lower the chances of survival.
